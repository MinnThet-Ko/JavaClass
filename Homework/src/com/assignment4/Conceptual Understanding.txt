1. In OO design, there is a rule called, "Classes should be opened for extension and closed for modification".
By making use of inheritance, you can add new behaviors to the child classes while keeping the parent class untouched.

2. From my understanding, inheritance and polymorphism are closely related.
The parent class is the generalization as it will contain all the common data and functions 
and the child classes will be specialization as they will have their own unique features.

3. Overriding is modifying the functions of the parent class, as you can update the toString() method of java.lang.Object.
Overloading is creating methods with the same name but with different types of parameters.
